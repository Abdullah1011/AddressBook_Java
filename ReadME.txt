Simple "Address Book" Software by Java using NetBeans. I also use MySql Database (DB file is also included).

1.    Open Project File with latest "NetBeans" IDE.
2.    Create a Database on MySQL by localhost ...using any server like xamp or wamp server. you must run this server
3.    Database Name : "AddressBook" database username must be root and password is notting (don't worry this is default)
4.    Select "AddressBook" database and Import "AB_DB SQLfile.sql". You will be able to get all table and data
5.    Compail Project with NetBeans
6.    Login by "Mizan" and "1011"
7.    If you get any null exception then you should know your database is not connected properly
